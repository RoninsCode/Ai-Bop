# Ai-Bop
Bebop Drone – AI-Assisted Task Execution

This repository contains an in-development framework for controlling a Parrot Bebop Drone using AI-driven autonomy. The project integrates computer vision, sensor data processing, and task-oriented decision-making to enable semi-autonomous or fully autonomous drone operations.

Note: The codebase is under active development. Interfaces, modules, and workflows may change as features mature.

Features (Planned & In Progress)
Core Capabilities

Real-time communication with the Bebop Drone (video stream, telemetry, commands)

Modular AI-control layer for mission-specific tasks

Support for manual override and hybrid AI/manual control

Extensible plugin architecture for adding new autonomous behaviors

AI / Autonomy Components

Object detection & tracking (CV-based; model selection TBD)

Navigation pipeline (pose estimation, path planning)

Task planning via rule-based or ML-based logic

Safety modules (collision avoidance, geofencing, fail-safe landing)
